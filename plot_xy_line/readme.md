# plot xy-line
Code for batch plotting line plots of xy-like data.

The code expects at least two columns of data, where the first column is assumed    
to be the indenpendent variable ($x$) and the second column is expected to be  
the dependent variable $y$.

When running the code initially, a folder called `data` will be created.  
Data file(s) to be plotted are to placed in the `data` folder.  
All data files present in the `data` folder will be plotted.  
The plots are saved as `.png` files to a `png` folder by default.
