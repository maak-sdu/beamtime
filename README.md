# beamtime: a repository for working with beamtime data
In this repository, you will find several tools for x-ray scattering data collected during synchrotron beamtimes.  
All tools are Python-based and available as iPython notebooks (.ipynb files).

## General tools for powder x-ray diffraction and total scattering
Some general tools for powder x-ray diffraction (pxrd) and x-ray total scattering (xts) data:
- calibration and azimuthal integration of:
    - *ex situ* data.
    - *operando* data, including:
        - scaling to account for x-ray intensity fluctutations resulting from current decay in the storage ring.
        - background-subtraction.
<!-- - overview plot.
- line plot with no offset.
- line plot with offset.
- Pearson correlation analysis.
- Non-negative matrix factorization -->

## Beamline-specific tools
Some of the tools available in this repo are highly specific to experiments conducted in the Ravnsb√¶k Group, Aarhus University (previously University of Southern Denmark). 

### P02.1, PETRA III, DESY:
- merging subframes from P02.1, PETRA III, DESY.

### DanMAX, MAX IV:
- extrating .tif images from .h5 files from DanMAX, MAX IV.

### Balder, MAX IV:
- sorting, merging, etc., files from Balder, MAX IV.

## Setup and installation
The following setup and installation guide is applicable for conda distributions, i.e., Anaconda and Miniconda.

If not already created, create a new dedicated conda environment called `beamtime_env` with a `Python 3.9` installation from the `conda-forge` channel. In the `Anaconda Prompt`, type the following:
```
conda create -n beamtime_env -c conda-forge python=3.9
```
Activate the `beamtime_env` conda environment:
```
conda activate beamtime_env
```
Install all the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file from the `conda-forge` channel:
```
conda install -n beamtime_env -c conda-forge --file requirements.txt
```
To update all installed packages in the `beamtime_env` conda environment:
```
conda update -n beamtime_env -c conda-forge --all
```
Good luck with your beamtime data!
