# Pearson correlation analysis
The iPython notebook (`.ipynb` file) can be used to conduct Pearson correlation  
analysis for a series of data files.

The code expects data files, where the variable of interest is present in the  
second column, e.g., xy- or xye-formats.

The correlation analysis is done using the `numpy.corrcoef` function.
