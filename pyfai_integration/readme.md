# pyFAI integration
The iPython notebook (`.ipynb` file) will call the `pyfai-integrate` gui  
(graphical user interface) for azimuthal integration of powder x-ray diffraction  
(pxrd) data.

To be able to carry out the azimuthal integration, a calibration of the  
experimental geometry is needed. This can be obtained using the `pyfai-calib2`  
gui. Please refer to the `pyfai_calibration` folder of the `beamtime`  
repository.
