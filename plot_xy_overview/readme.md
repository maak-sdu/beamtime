# plot xy-overview
Code for making an overview plot of $xy$-like data.

The code expects at least two columns of data, where the first column is assumed  
to be the indenpendent variable ($x$) and the second column is expected to be  
the dependent variable ($y$).

When running the code initially, a folder called `data` will be created.  
Data file(s) to be plotted are to placed in the data folder.  
All data files present in the `data` folder will be plotted in alphanumerical 
order.  
The plots are saved as `.png` files to a `png` folder by default.
